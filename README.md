# A collection of lost SageMaker notebooks and scripts

<p align="center">
A (not so) long time ago, in a Cloud far, far away, <br />
scipts were written to solve problems, and once they <br />
solved their purpose, they are discarded and <br />
left to rot in the forgotten corners of the <br />
Central Galaxy Hard Drive.
</p>
<p align="center">
But turmoil has now engulfed the Search Index! <br />
The separatist movement of the scripts has now <br />
struck back, and emerged once again from their <br />
dark prison to see the bright light of day, <br />
in some kind hero's production environment. <br />
</p>
<p align="center">
Join them, in their quest to Script Resistance! <br />
</p>

## OK, how about a serious introduction now

The goal of this repository is to be a landing page for most of the scripts or notebooks written for Amazon SageMaker which solve a very specific issue or challenge, or just show a very interesting capability of the platform/API. This kind of content often is too limited in depth or hard to be made into a longer prose, so it cannot become a Medium blog post or an independent repository. Therefore, <s>these Lost Scripts unite here under the flag of the Script Resistance</s> I'm using this repository to host them, and share them with those who might have the same very specific issue that I've faced that one time I wrote that script.
